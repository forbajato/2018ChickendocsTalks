## Objectives

### Objectives

* Participants will understand the importance of thinking about the kidney when facing disease states such as diabetes, HSP and spina bifida.
* Participants will develop a plan for first steps evaluation and nephroprotection in the above mentioned disease states.

## Abstract

### Abstract

The kidney is affected by a variety of disease states.  Some are
intrinsically renal in origin but many are not.  The generalist can be
expected to see patients with diabetes, HSP or spina bifida in the
course of a normal practice.  All of these affect the kidney in
different ways.  This talk will cover the primary reno-protective
measures a primary care physician can employ to make sure the
patient's kidney will last as long as possible in these disease
states.

# Diabetes
\frame{\tableofcontents[hideothersubsections]}

## Diabetes in Children

### Diabetes in children

* Obesity is increasingly becoming a disease of younger and younger people.
* IDDM is most commonly linked to renal disease
* NIDDM is increasing in adolescents
* Proteinuria on urinalysis
* No edema on physical exam

<div class="notes" 
Should be sure learners know the difference between obesity and edema.
Should talk about the fact that IDDM is more commonly linked because the duration of disease is longer since it starts as a child.
</div>

## Clinical findings

### Microalbuminuria

* Can occur in both insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes
* Not massive proteinuria
	* protein:creatinine is low (usually total of 30-300mg albumin/g creatinine)
	* albumin is normal
* Due to protein leak at the tubule, not at the glomerulus
* Slow decline in GFR, leads to CKD over years
* Most patients present after years of diabetic disease - 15+

### Hematuria

* Unusual
* When present, think glomerular leak
* Adults have ticks and fleas - Think about other causes of renal disease - IgA, membranous, etc.
* Biopsy shows mesangial proliferation, glomerular sclerosis

## Renal protection

### Renal protection

* Consider ACEI to protect the tubules
* Monitor blood pressure and treat accordingly
* Control diabetes to slow progression of renal disease
	* Weight reduction
	* Lipid control (rarely needed in peds)
* No protein restriction (in peds)

### Monitoring

* Yearly screens for proteinuria in all diabetics
* q3 Month check of protein:creatinine ratio for patients with demonstrated proteinuria
	* Goal is less than 1000mg/day protein excretion (less than 500 is even better!)
* Blood pressure monitoring
* Follow potassium in patients on ACEI or ARB

## Presentation

### Presentation

* Palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia
* Arthritis/arthralgia
* Abdominal pain
* Renal disease

<!--Purpura (75% of patients) is gravity dependent as is the arthritis/arthralgia (just over 50-75% of patients).  
Often patients will also have edema which improves with elevating the edematous area, elevation will help the arthritis too. 
Abdominal pain can be accompanied by GI bleeding but massive GI bleeding is rare. (about 50% of patients)
Renal manifestations are non-nephrotic proteinuria and microscopic or macroscopic hematuria (25-50% of patients).-->

### IgAV Rash

### Immunfluorescence

\end{figure}

### Unusual manifestations

* Scrotal pain 
* Headache, seizures, encephalopathy
* Respiratory signs
* Keratitis and uveitis

<!--Scrotal pain, swelling, testicular pain and tenderness (2-38%), may mimic torsion.-->
<!--CNS manifestations - the vasculitis is in all organ systems, CNS may even have intracranial hemorrhage - keep in mind if the mental status suddenly deteriorates.-->
<!--CXRs in IgAV patients generally show mild interstitial changes with no significant respiratory symptoms.-->
<!--Eye manifestations are quite rare. If you see this think about other causes of the keratitis or uveitis.-->

## Management

### Management

* Maintain hydration, elevate edematous areas, etc.
* Treat pain
* Consider steroids
* Hospitalize

### Outpatient management

* NSAIDS - naproxen or ibuprofen
* Prednisone - rarely needed

<!--Steroids may improve symptoms but don't affect the clinical course.
NSAIDS do improve symptoms but watch renal function closely and be very careful if child has GI bleeding!-->

### Criteria for hospitalization

* Unable to maintain hydration
* Severe abdominal pain
* GI bleeding
* Mental status changes
* Limited self-care (secondary to joint pain)
* Renal insufficiency

### Monitoring

* 1/3 or patients will recur at least once
* Monitor urinalysis and BP weekly - q2w for the first 2 months after presentation
* Monitor monthly until 1 year after initial presentation
* Check BP and UA at annual well-child visits to monitor for adult disease onset

## Case Study

### A Case Study

17YO African American female referred from Family Medicine clinic.  Child followed at state Spina Bifida clinic for her whole life.  During routine visit in the Family Medicine clinic she was discovered to have hypertension.  Investigation revealed a hematocrit of 17mg/dL, creatinine of 9mg/dL.  Family medicine resident immediately referred to peds nephrology for evaluation and treatment.

### Varieties of neurogenic bladder

* Flaccid bladder
* High pressure bladder
* Hyperreflexic bladder
* Overactive sphincter
* Detrusor sphinctor dyssynergia

<!--Many ways to the problem, bottom line is the bladder doesn't empty, pressure backs up the system and that isn't good for the kidneys.-->

## Assessment

### Assessment

* Ultrasound of kidney and bladder
* Urodynamics (voiding cystourethrogram, cystometrogram/EMG)
* Consider DMSA/MAG3 renal scan
* Urine culture

<!--Ultrasound when you have a diagnosis.
Urodynamics to demonstrate the degree of dysfunction.
DMSA or MAG3 renal scan if the upper tract has abnormalities per ultrasound.
Urine culture only if there are UTI symptoms.-->

## Management

### Management - 4 Aspects

* Clean intermittent catheterization
* Consider anticholinergics
* UTIs
* Bowel management

<!--CIC is the mainstay of therapy. We say "clean" because it doesn't need to be sterile.  It won't take long for the child to be colonized, hence our desire to avoid urine culture unless there are clear signs of UTI. Most children that start early (less than 1YO) can self cath by age 5. Chinese docs don't like CIC and prefer indwelling caths - an approach that is associated with an increase in infection.
Anticholinergics are good if they have high pressure bladder or hyperreflexic bladder and VUR.
Cloudy, smelly urine -> increase CIC interval and increase fluids
Pain with CIC, gross hematuria, back or belly pain, lethargy, fever, vomiting -> consider a UTI
Prophylactic antibiotics? - I don't do it.
-->

### Management - CIC

* Mainstay of therapy
* Clean, not sterile
* Start early (< 1YO)
* Lanzhou approach != Alabama approach

### Management - Anticholinergics

* Oxybutynin (Ditropan)
	* < 12m - 0.1mg/kg tid
	* 1-5YO 0.2mg/kg tid
	* for > 5YO 5mg tabs tid, consider the transdermal preparation
* Tolterodine (Detrol)
	* for > 5YO children
	* 1-2mg bid
* Both have long acting forms suitable for older children

### Management - UTI

* Cloudy, smelly urine
	* Increase fluids
	* Increase frequency of CIC
	* Not necessarily a UTI
* UTI symptoms
	* pain during CIC
	* gross hematuria
	* back or belly pain
	* lethargy (think shunt malfunction too)
	* fever (think about that shunt!)
	* vomiting (more shunt worries)

### Management - Bowel

* Neurogenic bowel a common co-morbidity
* Most commonly constipated, may have laxity of anal sphincter
* Goal of therapy is timed elimination, use laxatives, suppositories, enemas, etc.
